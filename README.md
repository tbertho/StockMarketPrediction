In this Project i will follow different tutorials to get a better understanding of working with stock data and ML.


Random Forest on S&P500:

Like the name suggests the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O_BenficgE&t=4s used Random Forest to predict the S&P 500 with historical stock data.
Random Forest belongs to the ensemble learning family, which involves combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance and accuracy.
The base models in a Random Forest are decision trees. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on the value of a particular feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The "Random" in Random Forest comes from the fact that, during training, each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the training data. This process is called bootstrapping or bagging. This helps introduce diversity among the trees.

Advantages:

Random Forests are robust and can handle a mixture of numerical and categorical features.
They are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
Random Forests provide feature importance scores, helping to identify which features are more influential in making predictions.
